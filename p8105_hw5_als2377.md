This is my solution for Homework 5.

## Problem 1

Read in homicide data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Single Prop Test

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Iteration

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

Read in data and iterate over file names.

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("data"),
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("data/", path),
    data = map(path, read_csv)) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_remove_all(path, ".csv"), 
    path = str_remove_all(path, "data/"), 
    path = str_replace_all(path, "con", "control"), 
    path = str_replace_all(path, "exp", "experiment")) %>% 
  separate(path, into = c("control_arm", "subject_id")) 
```

    ## Warning: `cols` is now required when using unnest().
    ## Please use `cols = c(data)`

Make a spaghetti plot.

``` r
path_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(week_1:week_8, names_to = "week", values_to = "obs") %>% 
  mutate(
    week = str_remove_all(week, "week_")) %>%
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = obs, group = subject_id, color = subject_id)) + 
  geom_line() + facet_grid(.~control_arm) + 
  labs(
    title = "Observations Over Time by Control Arm", 
    x = "Week", 
    y = "Observation"
  )
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_als2377_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="90%" />

Looking at this plot of “Observations Over Time by Control Arm”, we can
see an overall trend of increasing values over time for all study
participants in the experimental group. In contrast, the observations
for the participants of the control group vary over time but the values
remain relatively stable in terms of the beginning and ending values
over the study period.

## Problem 3

Set up simulation.

``` r
sample = function(n = 30, mu = 0, sigma = 5) {
  samp_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n, mean = mu, sd = sigma)) 
  
  samp_data %>% 
    summarize(
      mu = mean(x),
      sigma = sd(x))
  
  samp_data %>%
    t.test() %>%
    broom::tidy()

}
```

Test Function

``` r
samp_results = 
  rerun(5000, sample(30, 0, 5)) %>% 
  bind_rows()
```
